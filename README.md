# hw-4-Web-APIs-Quiz

## Description

I have created a funk music quiz game using JavaScript, Web APIs, HTML, and CSS. At the start of the quiz, a timer counts down 75 seconds to answer all ten questions. For each incorrect answer, 10 seconds are knocked off the clock. At the end of the quiz, the user's score is the amount of time left on the clock, and it is recorded in the list of high scores.
